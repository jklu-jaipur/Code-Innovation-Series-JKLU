Problem Description:
Groundwater is the major source of freshwater for drinking, irrigation and
industrial purposes and has always been a hidden treasure because of its
dynamic nature. The health of the groundwater system is reflected in the
groundwater levels of the region. There is a need to develop a robust
application to understand the groundwater scenario and its resources of the
regions. Representative groundwater level data needs to be analysed using
statistical and arithmetical solutions along with the groundwater resources of
the country to identify the blocks/district/state which has been critical
compared to previous decade.

Solution Appearance:
The solution will empower every citizen of the nation with the right of consistent supply of water.
It is an automated system capable of detecting, analysing and predicting the groundwater levels.
The solution allows CGWB officials to analyse the levels on a geospatial map, monitor performance of many 
locations and identify the most and least water stressed areas.
The system operates on web-cloud without any or with minimum human intervention.
Our system can analyse the provided ground water data, identify trends, compare current status with past year levels.
