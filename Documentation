The current market contains various devices that monitor vital sign by using sensors connected through mobile devices with a wireless connection such as Bluetooth or WiFi. These 
devices, which include pulse sensors, connected glucometers such as the Wireless Blood Glucometer, or blood oxygen sensors, are limited to showing the data obtained by the sensor
to the user via the mobile device itself, and do not provide any type of information processing.
