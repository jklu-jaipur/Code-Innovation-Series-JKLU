Crediantial Manager
Problem Statement : To simplify managing and accessing of user crediantials like username and passwords .
Problem: In this era full of technology, we use multiple platforms like websites and apps and mostly these are password protected.
         So people who are not that technology friendly or lazy find it difficult to save these credentials somewhere secure and end
         up saving these on either notepad on phone or paper which is completely insecure.
Solution : Creating a mobile app which will store every crediantial securely with smart protection and is user friendly.
